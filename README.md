# SoilFertilityPrediction_OrganicFood
Introduction  

Healthy soil is the foundation for profitable, productive, and environment sound agriculture systems. By understanding how the soil processes that support plant growth and regulate environmental quantity are affected by management practices. Farmers are unable to understand the current situation of the soil conditions physically. To overcome this problem our project SOIL HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM helps in testing soil in more substantial and quantifiable way.Testing soil conditions will
reduce the time required to produce the crop and will result in higher yield to the crop. In this manner we can avoid crop failure
which is growing concern today. Soil temperature directly affects plant growth. In other words, nearly every crop slows down its growth when soil temperatures are below 9°C and above 50°C. Germination of various seeds requires different soil temperature ranges. For example, maize starts to germinate at soil temperatures from 7-10°C. Most organisms within soil thrive at temperatures between 25-35°C. Nitrification requires a soil temperature of 32°C. An AI model that gives the farmer estimates about the crop growth, the crop yield, and recommendations for products to make the yield better. Since it is not always possible to get soil information (but relatively easy to obtain weather data), we created a model that predicts the soil temperature by using only three information in this project scope:

1)Temperature (Celsius)
2)Relative Humidity (%)
3)Wind Speed (km/h)


**Solution part of this project Includes how to connects farmers, consumers and experts who assist farmers with more technical data on weather and soil conditions that would affect harvest, crops and sowing time. It's also a platform for consumers to find local organic food and get expert-level information on their growth conditions Created deep learning model and with a QR code that contained the predicted soil temperature and various weather forecast information**

The only thing farmer should do is open his/her Location Services on the cellphone and the application will show the farmer (and also the expert on the other side) the required data like:
    
1)Weather Forecast Summary
2)Temperature
3)Soil Temperature
4)Predicted Soil Temperature (Using Deep Learning model)
5)Soil Moisture
6)Humidity
7)Air Quality Index etc.



One of the most important global goals is to achieve ‘food security’ in cities through the production of organic food by revitalizing the soil. 
The challenge is how can it be done? In order to come up with innovative ideas,with the advent of Emerging Technologies we are attempting 
to rejuvenate the soil health for reviving the ecology of our environment to provide organic food; in which we participated with full enthusiasm.
Soil health is connected with several aspects of ecology like plant growth and productivity, regulation of the carbon cycle, improving biodiversity, developing resistance to pests, and supports the water cycle. Protecting, managing, and restoring soil health has multiple benefits of carbon sequestration, improving biodiversity, regulating the water cycle, and improving food security.


# ExecuteInstructionsforJupyterNotebooks 

nbterm Lets you view, edit and execute Jupyter Notebooks in the terminal.

Install
Using pip:

pip install nbterm
Using conda:

mamba install nbterm -c conda-forge
You will also need a kernel, e.g. ipykernel or xeus-python for Python, xeus-cling for C++.

Usage
Open an interactive notebook:

$ nbterm OrganicFood.ipynb.ipynb
Run a notebook in batch mode:

$ nbterm --run OrganicFood.ipynb.ipynb

Key bindings Considerations :
There are two modes: edit mode, and command mode.

enter: enter the edit mode, allowing to type into the cell.
esc: exit the edit mode and enter the command mode



# Benefits

Healthy human beings  health is the top priority   – Organic food helps and support 
1)Extend lifespan of our planet by effectively using water
2)Reduction in the use of non-renewable resources
3)Effective yield to support the demand
